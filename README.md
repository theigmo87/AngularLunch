# Angular/.Net Web Api 2 Boilerplate
A demo project for a hands-on Angular lunch and learn. The starter folder has an incomplete project for you to 
fill in the gaps to make a working angular app. The other folder has the completed app.

<p>
To get this working, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system and that you have put the PATH variable at the top position in your Visual Studio external tools list (so that it uses the Node.js you downloaded, not the outdated one that comes with Visual Studio). You may also want to install gulp-cli and gulp globally as you will use these a lot, but this isn't necessary. 
<br>
<br>
<code>
npm install -g gulp-cli gulp
</code>
<br>
<br>
To get this running, open the solution in Visual Studio 2015, allow the node packages to download and install, then the task runner should become available when it is finished. You could also just run
<br><br> 
<code> npm install </code>
<br><br> 
in the AngularLunch project folder, followed by
<br><br> 
<code> gulp </code>
</p>
